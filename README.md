### shopApp

This is my project at server-backend course at school. MariaDB database was in a AWS and whole system was hosted on Linux server. (server and database is currently offline) Web-app have also login and sign-up page. Basically user have a own shopping list which he/she can update with CRUD functions.

UI also by me.
